## Piratelang - A language for those who sail the seven seas!
Piratelang is a dynamically-typed interpreted scripting language based on pirates.

## Usage
Currently, you can't use anything yet! This programming language is still basically in its baby steps and as such, there is nothing to really see here.

If you want to try some stuff out, you can clone the repo and use `cargo test` to try some of the tests.

## Roadmap
- [x] Add basic type primitives
- [x] Declare variables
- [x] If statements
- [x] Mathematical operators
- [x] Functions
- [ ] File imports
- [ ] Think about possible data structures (structs, enums) and implement them
- [ ] Think about interfaces and implement them
- [ ] Design a standard library
- [ ] Write a standard library
- [ ] Add some HTTP primitives to the library
- [ ] Write a web server using Piratelang

## Syntax
Currently, the only syntax we really have is this:
```
yarr <variable_name> be <expr>

if <expression that equals true here> {
    {some expression here}
}
```

You can view the examples folder to find out what kinds of operations are supported.

Currently, the following primitive types are supported:
- Strings (use double quotes)
- Booleans (`true` or `false`)
- Numbers (up to 64-bit signed integers)

## But why?
Why not?
