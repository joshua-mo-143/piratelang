## Piratelang - A language for those who sail the seven seas!
Piratelang is a dynamically-typed interpreted scripting language based on pirates.

This is *primarily* a hobby project, but with the eventual aim of being usable for more than hobbyist workloads.

## Usage
To try out Piratelang, you can run the REPL in this repo (`cargo run -p repl` from the root folder). You can also look at the examples folder (within `_examples`) if you want to have a cursory look at what code currently looks like, as they are used for tests.

## Roadmap

- [x] Declare variables
